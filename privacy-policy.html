    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to CTF Game ("we," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect your information. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the personal data we collect through our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your precise GPS location when using the app to enable real-world gameplay and flag capture</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Data:</strong> Flags captured, experience points (XP), level, captures, and game progress</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, and app version</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> How you interact with the app's features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Gameplay:</strong> Enable location-based flag capture and team competition</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Create and manage your user account</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Display rankings and competitive statistics</li>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Track your XP, level, and achievements</li>
        <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Analyze usage patterns to improve features and fix bugs</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Prevent fraud, abuse, and unauthorized access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Why We Collect It:</strong> The App requires your precise location to determine when you are near a flag location and enable you to capture it. This is core to the gameplay experience.</p>
    <p><strong>When We Collect It:</strong> Only when the app is actively in use (foreground). We do not collect location data when the app is closed or in the background.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Control It:</strong> You can disable location access in your device settings, but this will prevent you from playing the game.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</strong></p>
    
    <p>We may share limited data in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Within the App:</strong> Your username, team, level, and leaderboard statistics are visible to other players</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. You can request deletion of your account and all associated data at any time through the app's Profile → Delete Account feature.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>

        <li><strong>Location Control:</strong> Disable location access in device settings (will prevent gameplay)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt hashing</li>
        <li>Data transmission is secured with HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
        <li>Authentication tokens are stored securely in your device's keychain</li>
        <li>Server infrastructure follows security best practices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.</p>

        <li>Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
        <li>Sending an in-app notification or email (for significant changes)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
