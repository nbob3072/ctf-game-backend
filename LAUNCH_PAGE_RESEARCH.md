## Executive Summary

The best mobile game landing pages in 2024-2026 share common traits: **cinematic/immersive design, mobile-first architecture, persistent CTAs, social proof, and fast loading**. Top games like Pokémon GO, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and Destiny 2 convert visitors through emotion-driven copy, scroll-triggered animations, and direct-to-consumer strategies.

**Key Insight:** Landing pages are the "digital CD covers" of modern gaming—they must capture attention in seconds and guide users toward one clear action.
